  <h1>Japanese Beginners </h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>Chapter 1: I am a cat</h2>
  
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      <b>watashi wa neko desu: I am a cat</b>
    </p>  
  </div>

  <h3> Main</h3>
   <p> 
  
    Watashi: I. This is quite a polite way to say 'I'. Interestingly enough, there are quite a few different ways. 
    In Japanese, pronouns are often left out when it's clear from the context who is being talked about. 
    I could therefore say 'neko desu' when people are aware that I am the person being talked about. 

    wa: this is a topic marker and comes after the word being talked about. In this it's refers back to 'neko'. Japanese has no articles like in English or most European 
    languages, but they do have a few of these 'particles'. More on this later.  

    Neko: cat, cats. 
    There is no difference between singular and plural either for nouns. 'neko' can mean 'cat' or 'cats'. 

    Desu: to be. 
    The good news is that this verb stays the same no matter who is or who are something. It doesn't change whether there are 1, 2 or more people who are something. 
    Same goes for all verbs in Japanese. 
    So there is no difference between 'I read' and "he readS' either.
    Verbs can always be found at the end of a sentence. 
   </p>

   <h3> The words.</h3>

  <p>

  <p> 

  Anata: you. Again, this word is not nearly used as much as we use 'you' in English. There are also multiple ways of saying 'you' in Japanese. 
  Often, people are addressed by their title, like teacher or chef instead, which brings us to...

  Sensei: teacher. This is used to talk about people who are teachers, but also to address them. The word is used by itself, but also added at the end of a last name. 
  Tanaka-sensei is therefore teacher Tanaka. 
  
  otoko: man. 

  onna: woman. 

  Now that we learned just four more words, we can make several new sentences. 

  anata wa sensei desu: you are a teacher. 
  sensei wa otoko desu: the teacher is a man. 
  anata wa onna desu: you are a woman. 
  
  desu is only used to make clear what someone is, not where someone or something is. There are other verbs for that purpose.
